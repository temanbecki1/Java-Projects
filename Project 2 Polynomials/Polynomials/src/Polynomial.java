/*
*This class will contain 4 methods
*Method 1 constructor
*accepts a tring that defines one polynomial in format from input file
*Method 2 a compareto method
*compares 2 polynomials, if they have different highest order the polynomial with highest exponent is the greatest, 
* if their highest exponents are the same == , their coefficients are compared.
*if two poly have the same highest order exponents with coef, next highest exponent is examined
*Method 3 an iterator method
*produces an iterator that iterates across the terms of the polynomial from highest exponent to lowest and returns an object
*containing coefficients and exponent of the next term
*Method 4 a toString method
*converts a polynomial to a string - terms with 0 coefficients should be omitted entirely
*terms with exponent of 1 should omit the exponent
*terms with exponent of 0 should omit the variable x as well
